                    <p>
                        I am an experienced ServiceNow and process improvement developer/engineer that is focused on creating an environment that the end user will find intuitive, engaging, and informative. It is my goal to automate myself out of a job through sound processes, education, and change management. I strive to be a partner in business to all stakeholders because I believe that friction created by the system is what drives the user away from using the tools put in place for them and will find workarounds or alternatives.                </p>
